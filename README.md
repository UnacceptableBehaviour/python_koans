Thinking AboutAsserts
test_assert_truth has damaged your karma.

You have not yet reached enlightenment ...
AssertionError: False is not true

Please meditate on the following code:
File "/Users/simon/a_syllabus/lang/python/repos/python_koans/python3/koans/about_asserts.py", line 17, in test_assert_truth
self.assertTrue(False) # This should be True


You have completed 0 (0 %) koans and 0 (out of 37) lessons.
You are now 302 koans and 37 lessons away from reaching enlightenment.

Beautiful is better than ugly. (but I have the bottle opener!)
